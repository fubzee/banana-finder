// An idea for the function:
// Moment js to get date information 
// pull release date for song from API
// pull play count for song from API (maybe spotify or itunes API's)
// calculate how long the song has been out, and use that to work out how many times the track is played per month
// create a scale to compare to and append a freshness response to mobileResults.HTML

var currentYearMJS = moment().format("YYYY");
